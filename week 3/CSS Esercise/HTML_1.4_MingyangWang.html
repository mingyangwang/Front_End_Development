					Helsinki Central Library Oodi is a living meeting place at
					Kansalaistori square, right at the heart of Helsinki. Oodi will
					complement the cultural and media hub formed by Helsinki Music Centre,
					Finlandia Hall, Sanoma House and the Museum of Contemporary Art
					Kiasma. Oodi will be a non-commercial, urban public space that is open
					to all, right opposite the Parliament Building. It is one of 37
					branches of Helsinki City Library and part of the Helmet library
					network. Oodi will provide its users with knowledge, new skills and
					stories, and will be an easy place to access for learning, story
